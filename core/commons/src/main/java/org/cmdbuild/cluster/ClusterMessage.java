	 * Message.RSVP flag: when this flag is encountered, the message send blocks
	 * until all members have acknowledged reception of the message (of course
	 * excluding members which crashed or left meanwhile).
	 *
	 * This also serves as another purpose: if we send an RSVP-tagged message,
	 * then - when the send() returns - we’re guaranteed that all messages sent
	 * before will have been delivered at all members as well. So, for example,
	 * if P sends message 1-10, and marks 10 as RSVP, then, upon JChannel.send()
	 * returning, P will know that all members received messages 1-10 from P.
	 *
	 * Note that since RSVP’ing a message is costly, and might block the sender
	 * for a while, it should be used sparingly. For example, when completing a
	 * unit of work (ie. member P sending N messages), and P needs to know that
	 * all messages were received by everyone, then RSVP could be used.
